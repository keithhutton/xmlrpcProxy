General information
-------------------

The Xmlrpc proxy acts as a proxy for Xmlrpc calls.  All the hard work is
done by Spring Boot and the Apache XmlRpc libraries, plus some slightly modified code
taken from the Apache XmlRpc source.
This proxy may be useful for calling web services that require Java 7 or higher to
work with HTTPS from legacy systems running on Java 6 or lower that cannot be
easily migrated to a higher version of Java.
